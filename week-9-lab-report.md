For our trace, we will be examining the second screenshot, analyzing the case of a **COMPILE ERROR**  
Following our code:  
-rm -rf student-submission <--- Attempts to remove any current student-submission. Return code: 0
echo "Cloning into student submission" <--- Output: "Cloning into student submission" Error: "" Return code:0  
git clone $1 student-submission 2> /dev/null <--- Return code: 0
echo "Cloning completed!"  <--- Output: "Cloning completed" Return code: 0
error=0  
javac -target 1.8 -cp ".;..lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar" ListExamples.java TestListExamples.java <--- Return code:0 
rm ListExamples.class   
  CP="..;../lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:../lib/junit-4.13.2.jar"  
cd student-submission
  
ls -a > fileList.txt  
if [ $(grep -c "ListExamples.java" fileList.txt) -eq 0 ]  <--- Condition is false since file "ListExamples.java" was found| Return code:0
then  
    echo "\"ListExamples.java\" not found, check to see that you've submitted the proper files"  <--- Not run since if is false  
    exit 1  <--- Not run since if is false  
fi  

echo "ATTEMPTING TO COMPILE..."  <--- Output: "ATTEMPTING TO COMPILE..." Return code: 0  
javac -cp $CP *.java <--- Compiles files ending with .java, fails to compile and prints error Return code: 1  
if [ $? -ne 0 ] <-- Return code is currently 1 so does not equal 0 therefore this evaluates to true since 1 != 0   
then <-- Runs since if was true  
    echo "COMPILE ERROR, Score: 0.00/2.00" <--- Output: "COMPILE ERROR, Score: 0.00/2.00"  
    echo "Make sure that your program compiles properly" <--- Output: "Make sure that your program compiles properly"  
    exit 1 <-- Script exits with exit code 1  
fi  
Since our script exited with this if statement, the code that comes after will not run.
