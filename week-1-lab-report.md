**Hail, traveler.**  
I see you are looking for information regarding remote connections in **CSE 15L**

**Step 2**  
Once you've got VS Code situated, lets use it to connect to the 15l servers remotely.  
In VS Code, navigate towards the top bar with drop down menus until you find yourself at the one called **termnial**  
Click on it and then click on the option **New termianl*  
Once doing this, the terminal should appear on the bottom half of the screen.  
To login to the remote server, type the following command into the terminal  
  
  **ssh cse15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu**  
    
replacing the **"zz"** with the two letters in your given username.  
After doing so, you should be prompted with terminal messages that look similar to this:
